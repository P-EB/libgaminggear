Build-Dependends built using a minimal container and calling cmake until it's
happy, and then make until it builds.  Doxygen is optional in practise, but
as we also want to compile the documentation it's required. SQLITE3 is also
optional, but searched by cmake, so we use it.

Depends: list built by inspecting all headers files, and making sure no
include of a .c file is done.

When upgrading from upstream, check if anything changed in these.
