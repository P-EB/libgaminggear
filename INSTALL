* First make sure the dependencies are met

  * You will need some development tools and header packages. For ease of use,
    there are some install_deps_* scripts for various distributions in the scripts
    folder of this package, which you can execute or take as a guideline.

* Compilation and Installation

  In any shell type the following:

  $ tar -xjf libgaminggear-X.X.X.tar.bz2
  $ cd libgaminggear-X.X.X
  $ mkdir build
  $ cd build
  $ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="/usr" ..
  $ make
  $ sudo make install

  * optional cmake entries you can set with -D:

    * CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE         If you want useful debug information in case of
      errors use Debug. Default is Release.

    * INSTALL_CMAKE_MODULESDIR If cmake doesn't find the right install directory
      for cmake modules, you can set it manually. Normally it's /usr/share/cmake/Modules.

    * INSTALL_LIBDIR           If cmake doesn't find the right install directory
      for libraries, you can set it manually. For 64bit systems that's normally
      $PREFIX/lib64 but Ubuntu uses $PREFIX/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/.

    * INSTALL_PKGCONFIGDIR     If cmake doesn't find the right install directory
      for pkg-config, you can set it manually. Normally it's /usr/share/pkgconfig
      or /usr/lib*/pkgconfig.

    * WITH_UHID, WITH_UINPUT   Set either one to TRUE if you want to force one
                               method. Per default uhid is preferred over uinput.

    * UHID_DIR, UINPUT_DIR     If cmake doesn't find the right location of the
      uhid or uinput device, you can set it manually. Normally it's in /dev or
      /dev/input.
      
    * WITH_DOC                 Set this to TRUE if you want to build the API
      documentation.

    * GFX_PLUGIN_DIR

  * It is strongly recommended to install everything in /usr instead of the default
    directory /usr/local.

* Finishing steps

  * For input events to work for users (needed for software macros and such) they
    need access rights for uinput or uhid. To use them as normal user you should
    create an extra group like

    $ sudo groupadd --system uinput-users

    and add all needed users to this group.

    $ sudo usermod -a -G uinput-users $USER
	
    Create a file like /etc/udev/rules.d/90-uinput.rules containing the lines

    KERNEL=="uinput", GROUP="uinput-users", MODE="0660"
    KERNEL=="uhid", GROUP="uinput-users", MODE="0660"

	Also you need to make sure the modules are loaded automatically. For this
    create a file /etc/modules-load.d/uinput.conf with either uinput or uhid as
    it's content.

	Unload/reload the module or reboot.

  * Refresh the icon cache

    Call the command

    $ sudo touch --no-create /usr/share/icons/hicolor

    where /usr has to be substituted with your install prefix.

* Building an rpm

  The package contains the file libgaminggear.spec that fits at least fedora which
  you can use.
  The easiest way is to write
  
  $ rpmbuild -ta --clean libgaminggear-X.X.X.tar.bz2
  
  which creates all rpms on the fly
